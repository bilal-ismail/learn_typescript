    I love the legend of ${convince[0]} and would love to own one for street racing. 
    But for the comfort I'd like to drive in a ${convince[1]}. 
    I also have a personal favourite to showcas, that being the first generation ${convince[3]}.
    Another car that i feel is like a new generation racecar is a ${convince[2]}, I would'nt want to own one but I just like it.
